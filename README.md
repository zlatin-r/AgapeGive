# AgapeGive

**AgapeGive** is a Christian donation platform designed to connect generous hearts with those in need. Inspired by the biblical concept of *Agape*—unconditional love—the app allows users to:

- **Create Causes**: Share a need or mission and invite others to contribute.
- **Donate Securely**: Support ministries, charities, or individuals with ease and transparency.
- **Track Impact**: See how your generosity is making a difference in real time.

AgapeGive empowers believers to live out the words of Jesus:

> *“It is more blessed to give than to receive”* (Acts 20:35)

Foster a community of love, compassion, and tangible help through AgapeGive.
